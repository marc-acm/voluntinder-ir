## Application Design

Demonstrate your ability to break down the problem and design a solution.

1. One page summary of your application including problem definition, solution. -- **DONE**
2. Determine the appropriate client technology, development tools, and platform for writing the UI -- **Maybe talk about why we chose React + React Redux + Whatever and then explain the folder structure and the special components maybe?**
3. Wireframes for at least 3 screens. **Marc**
 

For the wireframes we have created two types, one for the desktop/laptop design and the other is for mobile devices.


The first three screenshots are for the desktop/laptop design.  The prospect is to provide a three-frame application consisting of the following:

- Landing Page
- Opportunities
- Details of A Specific Opportunity

The application is designed with an option of a static bar to be shown throughout the three frames. 

#Landing Page

This contains the Sign-up Form for people who desires to have their profile match with a specific project.
  


 
#Project/Opportunities

The second frame provides a view of the different available projects.



#Specific Opportunity

This page will show the details for a single specific project.

4. User stories for the whole application. 

As for our user stories, we have three (3) types of users


User (Volunteer)



Institutions (eg. NGOs)


Admin (


t 
5. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
